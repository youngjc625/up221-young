## Profile
My name is Young Jin Choi (I go by Young) and I'm a second-year MPP student interested in social and economic equity.

## Course Description
The goal for this course is to expose you to the foundations of spatial data science. How can data be transformed into human expressions and narratives, and how can these be represented spatially? Our understanding of social phenomena through spatial constructs in urban data allows us to address location-based questions on social justice, the environment, transportation, community development and design, amongst many other themes, and how these factors may affect different population groups in different ways. This course prepares you for challenges in urban data beyond off-the-shelf cartographic approaches. It looks at the various components of data’s journey—acquisition, exploration, modeling, and communication through visualization—and how it enables and advances your research from a data science perspective.

## Project Ideas
- Spatial visualization of racial wealth gap in CA
- Spatial visualization of children who would receive baby bonds as we incrementally increase the percentage of a wealth tax (e.g. the interitance tax or the capital gains tax)
- Spatial visualization of children bereaved of parents due to COVID, born into foster care, born through Medi-Cal, and all children in poverty in CA

## Objectives
1. Develop spatial analysis/visualization skills
2. Apply GIS skills learned in the course to perform analyses for APP project (see project ideas ^)
3. Gain basic programming skills
