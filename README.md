My name is Young Jin Choi (I go by Young) and I'm a second-year MPP student interested in social equity and economic justice. I like to work out, travel (including local excursions), and share good food with friends.

## Course Description
This will be my first exposure to spatial data science. I'm interested in transforming data into "human expressions and narratives" and representing them spatially though visualization. I'm also interested in learning about location-based issues of social and economic equity, impacts of climate change, community development and design, etc. and gaining the skills to visually illuminate such issues for public understanding and policy change.

## Project Ideas
- Spatial visualization of racial wealth gap in CA
- Spatial visualization of children who would receive baby bonds as we incrementally increase the percentage of a wealth tax (e.g. the interitance tax or the capital gains tax)
- Spatial visualization of children bereaved of parents due to COVID, born into foster care, born through Medi-Cal, and all children in poverty in CA

## Objectives
1. Develop spatial analysis/visualization skills
2. Apply GIS skills learned in the course to perform analyses for APP project (see project ideas ^)
3. Gain basic programming skills
